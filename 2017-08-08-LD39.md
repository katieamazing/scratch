Time for another Ludum Dare game jam! As is typical, I did the jam (72 hours, slightly relaxed rules, teams allowed - hi [@Johnicholas](https://twitter.com/Johnicholas)). The theme was **"running out of power"**. We got really lucky with the theme - we actually concepted this game about a week early, and hoped for a theme we could shoehorn in somehow. That worked out this time!

I have been playing a lot of No Man's Sky lately, so a universe-exploring, procedurally-generated universe sounded fun to create. And we play a lot of a wonderful multiplayer game called Nom Nom Galaxy, a side-scrolling platformer where you explore planets, punch strange plants and animals, and make soup out of them. And so, inspired by Sims2/3 winemaking, we mashed some of our favorite games together to make Sip Sip Universe: an adventure on procedurally generated planets to explore, pick fruits, and make wines.

One of the concepts was to use some **procedural generation** to multiply the assets. I created fruits and planets in multiple SVG layers using Inkscape, and programmatically selected layers and render colors. This really worked out, and we achieved a lot of variety:

![planets, fruits]()

Another concept was **persisted multiplayer data** to allow players to name and store their wines in a "Winecellar Between the Worlds". This added some permanence and interest to the process of making and naming bottles. I wrote a Lua backend on webscript.io to handle the data, which I had done before. The new part for me was sending the requests from Javascript. It was very satisfying to implement ES6 promises seamlessly, after some months of learning about them tangetially. Getting the dialog boxes to play nicely was challenging, and they still don't look as slick as I imagined them, but it did add a lot to the game and was a top highlight for many players.

Exploring planets was a big part of the game concept, and unfortunately the area we made the deepest cuts to during the jam. While you can walk around and enjoy a partially programmatically-generated world while you collect fruits, we did not implement terrain collisions on the planet surface. We also considered having destructible terrain, as No Man's Sky and Nom Nom Universe have. We also imagined having some enemies to fight or avoid. Lastly, we imagined an "underworld" that felt more like a cave spelunking or roguelike that the player might access through holes in the planet's crust. We didn't get anywhere near enough time for this in the original 72 hours!

We also wanted planet and ingredient descriptions to have procedural descriptions and qualities. Another procedural element that got cut for time was a music system.

However, we continued work on this game in the following weeks, and I am pleased to present the Sip Sip Universe Platinum Post-Jam 2017 Thing of the Year Edition.

The most pleasing thing for me was how this entry tied together many of my educational efforts over the last weeks and months.

I had recently completed a [JavaScript game](http://katieamazing.com/blog/2017/02/24/moon-sugar) that went pretty well, and that I did very little visual art for. I ran with that for this Ludum Dare. I had a conference to attend from 8am-5pm on Friday and Saturday, so I knew I would have less time than usual, even doing the 72-hour Jam. So choosing to stay out of Photoshop was a time-saving and energy-saving step that really worked out.

I used SVG for the first time ever (!) to do all the graphics. A few days before, I randomly spent a couple hours at the Recurse Center pairing with a batchmate who was exploring SVG for the first time. I did this without Ludum Dare in mind, but I used a lot of the orientation to SVG I got during that pairing to make the game. I used Inkscape to generate the SVG code for the sprites.

We used vanilla JavaScript to do all of the coding. Back in January when I was doing Wes Bos's [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course, I was inspired by the demonstration of the built-in browser support for voice recognition. I held onto that inspiration for the next Ludum Dare. This is the first time a commitment to a specific technology/technique before the theme announcement has not bitten me in the ass during the Ludum weekend. I was really pleased with the scope, complexity, and flexibility of using JavaScript and voice recognition.

As always, there are things that didn't go as planned.
  * I had hoped to do more physics animation of the SVG elements. I looked into some libraries to do this, but we ended up not having time to implement very much extra.
  * Just ran out of time on UI/background polishing stuff. It is functional, but I think it could be cooler.
  * We didn't add any sound at all - this was semi-intentional, as we imagined that adding sound effects and music might interfere with the voice recognition, but I still missed doing it. Sound really adds a lot to a game!
  * And finally, submitting to this particular LD was a stressful nightmare. The Ludum Dare site is still significantly under construction, and that was really unpleasant to deal with after a long day of work on the game.

But we did it! Yay LD38, another one for my memory books!
