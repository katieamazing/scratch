title: "RC Return Statement"
date: TODO
---

-overall struggled with outside world distractions of the political kind
-the balance between RC-as-work and RC-as-social-reactor
-struggled after going to staff and talking through my issues in week 9, and having no interactions with them after that. Did not feel supported or that they were interested in my success at all, even after I reached out and expressed my concerns.

-having a different idea of what RC would be from reading old blog posts from alums
  -no residents
  -less oversight/faciliator support (I was continually surprised by the disinterest of the staff)
  -larger groups/less batch cohesion
  -gender balance issues (too much representation of male sr/female jr, which I think leads to too many male-led activities. Far too many all-male presentation nights.)

-goal for this post is to provide a reflection on what RC was in the spring of 2017, with the caveat that the culture changes quickly with each batch.

-post a link to or a cut for the whole To-Do file.

-all the stuff I read, and a quick overview of what I did
