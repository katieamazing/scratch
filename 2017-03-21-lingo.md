There are general technical terms, like iterator, generator, trace, etc. They are useful terms to know for the newbie programmer because they allow one to Google for answers to technical questions more effectively. This post won't cover those.

There are also buzzwords, like scalable, functional, and cloud-based, or more specific like Node.js, Firebase, or Neural Networks. These tend to be domain-specific and often refer to "the hot new thing," whether that be a trendy idea of how a basic service works or a specific popular new technology. This post also will not cover these.

This post will cover programmer idioms. Or rather, the most impenetrable programmer idioms. There are some programmer idioms that have fairly clear meanings decipherable from their onomonopeic sound (kludge), and there are others that are quite guessable from context ("squashing" a bug). The following idioms are the ones I have encountered that I could have used a guidebook for:

programmer idioms

yak-shaving
rubber ducking
koan/kata
nerdsniping
grok
dogfood/dogfooding

monkey-patching
footgun language/feature


foo/bar/baz
8 queens
fizzbuzz

cookie licking - laying claim to a task without actually engaging it, thereby preventing others from working on it while not working on it oneself; often in bug assignment or to-dos.

duck punching/duck typed
paging: the act of recalling something stored to "deep memory" disk. "'Hey do you remember that app from last year's widget usage?' 'Hang on a second, paging..."
