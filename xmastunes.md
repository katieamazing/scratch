to the tune of "O Christmas Tree"

Binary Tree, Binary Tree
Your nodes are bright and sparkly
I traverse you recursively
Binary Tree, Binary Tree

hip hip array

to the tune of "Silent Night"

Linked list, linked list
Pointers to the next node
O(1) to add a new node
O(n) to access a node
Terrible for random access
Linked linked list

to "we three kings"

Three techniques for algo design
They can make your programs shine
Greedy, Dynamic, Divide and Conquer
They'll help with your deadline

O greedy algo, locally best
Dynamic, memoize don't retest
Divide and conquer, break into subproblems
Recursively solve and take a rest
