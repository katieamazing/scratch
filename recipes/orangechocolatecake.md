Source: Streamliner Diner Cookbook

##Ingredients
2 cups unbleached white flour, sifted
1 tspn. salt
1 tspn. baking soda
1 tspn. baking powder

1/2 cup butter
1 cup granulated sugar
1 cup brown sugar, packed                        
3 eggs, seperated
1 cup buttermilk                                          
the zest and juice of 1 orange                   
1 tspn. vanilla extract

1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 cup boiling water

##Method
Preheat the oven to 350degF. Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.

In a large bowl, cream the butter with a mixer until soft. Add the sugars, and beat until light and fluffy. Add the 3 egg yolks and continue to beat until the mixure is light yellow in color. Beat in the orange zest and juice, and the vanilla extract.
In a small bowl or Pyrex measuring cup, combine the cocoa powder and boiling water, stirring vigorously to make a smooth paste. Add to the batter and beat until thoroughly incorporated.

Beat the egg whites with the salt until stiff, and set aside.

Sift together the flour, baking soda, and baking powder in a seperate bwol. Add half the dry ingredients to the batter alternately with the buttermilk, stirring gently after each addition to combine. Fold in the egg whites with a large spatula using as few strokes as possible - be very gentle and don’t worry about small lumps of egg white. Pour the batter into the pans.

Bake at 350degF for 30 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool in pans for 10 minutes, and then turn out and allow to cool completely before frosting.

##Frosting
2 oz. unsweetened chocolate, broken up or chopped roughly
1 cup butter, room temperature               
1/2 cup sour cream
1 tspn. vanilla extract
4 cups sifted powdered sugar

Melt the chocolate over a double boiler, and set aside to cool. With an electric mixer, cream the butter until light and fluffy. Add sour cream and continue to beat until combined. Add sugar, a little at a time, continuing to beat until smooth. Add vanilla and melted chocolate, and mix thoroughly.

Tips:
Don’t blow off sifting the noted ingredients; it makes a major difference in the final cake.
Remember that batter ingredients go together better when they are at room temperature.
