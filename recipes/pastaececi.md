Makes: two generous servings

##Ingredients
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed
3 tablespoons tomato paste
1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
1/4 teaspoon MSG, such as Accent
Freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 15-oz can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1/2 cup (2 ounces or 55 grams) uncooked ditalini pasta (or another small shape; I use annelini)
2 cups (475 ml) boiling water

##Method

Fry garlic until very fragrant but barely browned. Add and fry tomato paste and spices for 30 seconds. Add all remaining ingredients, bring to a simmer, and cook for 12-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is cooked to your taste.
