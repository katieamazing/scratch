#Nancy Hannick's Plum Cake

##Ingredients
2 lbs. fresh Italian prune plums                          
1 cup sugar                                                              
1/2 cup (one stick) butter, softened                  
2 eggs
1 tspn. vanilla   
3/4 cup milk
2 cups flour    
2 tspn. baking powder                                                                  

##Method
Preheat the oven to 350degF. Grease a 13”x9” baking pan.

Wash and halve the plums. Cream the butter and the sugar together until fluffy, and add the eggs. Beat mixture until light yellow in color, at least 2 minutes. Add remaining ingredients and mix until just combined. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Nestle the plum halves cut side down atop the batter, and sprinkle the pan with a little cinnamon and sugar. Bake at 350degF for 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted between the plums near the center comes out clean.
