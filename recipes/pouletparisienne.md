#Poulet Parisienne

Serves 4

##Ingredients
3 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken parts (thighs preferred for economy and flavor, but any parts will work)
olive oil
salt and pepper
1 shallot, diced finely
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms (a mix of criminis and shitakes is great, but anything will work)
1/2 cup brandy or cognac (wine will do in a pinch)
3/4 cup heavy or whipping cream
1 tsp. dried thyme
Equipment: a large, deep stewing pan or frying pan (NOT nonstick) with a lid, whisk

##Method
Trim chicken of excess fat, and score skin if desired. Season meat lightly with salt and pepper. Heat 2 Tblspn. olive oil in pan over high heat until shimmering, and add chicken. Sear meat until brown on both sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate, cover with foil or another plate. Turn heat on the pan down to medium.

Add the shallot, thyme, and mushrooms. Saute until the shallot is translucent and the mushrooms have cooked down, about 10 minutes. Deglaze the pan with the liquor, whisking vigorously to dislodge any burned brown bits from the bottom.

Add the cream, stirring gently to combine. Place the chicken skin-side up in the pan on top of the sauce, leaving the top of the meat out of the sauce. Return any juices from the plate to the pan. Cover tightly with the lid, turn heat down to low, and allow to simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 40 minutes.
