Source: Gourmet Magazine (?)
Makes 18 rolls, takes 2.5 hours

##Ingredients
3 Tblspn. sugar
1/4 oz. package of active dry yeast (2.5 tspn.)
2 eggs
1/3 cup milk
1/4 cup (half a stick) unsalted butter, melted and cooled, plus additional melted butter for brushing on
1 tspn. salt
3/4 cup mashed cooked sweet potatoes (yield from 3/4 lb raw potatoes)
3 to 4 cups all-purpose flour

##Method
In a small bowl, stir together 1 table spoon of the sugar with 1/4 cup warm water (about skin temperature). Sprinkle the yeast over the mixture and let it proof for 5 minutes until it is foamy.

In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar, the milk, the butter, the salt, the sweet potatoes, and the yeast mixture until everything is well combined. Stir in 3 cups of the flour, a cup at a time, and turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Knead the dough, incorporating as much of the remaining cup of flour as is necessary to prevent the dough from sticking. Knead the dough 8 to 10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic, and springs back when poked with a finger. Form the dough into a ball, and put into a well-buttered bowl, turning the dough to coat it. Let the dough rise, covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place for about one hour, or until doubled in size.

Turn the dough back out onto a floured surface, and cut off pieces about the size of a walnut. Form pieces into balls, and place three each into buttered muffin tins. You should be able to make 18 rolls. Brush the tops of the rolls with melted butter,  and let the rolls rise, covered loosely, in a warm place for 30-45 minutes or until they are almost doubled in size.

Bake the rolls in a preheated 400degF oven for 12-15 minutes, or until they are golden. Be careful not to overbake.
