#5-Ingredient Mexichicken

##Ingredients
a couple pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken parts (I always use thighs as they are cheap and extremely
difficult to dry out, but any parts will work)
1/2 to 1 cup salsa (jarred, homemade, or stolen from your local Mexican restaurant)
taco seasoning (this recipe assumes with salt; if salt-free, apply salt as well)
black pepper
olive oil
Equipment: one ceramic or Pyrex baking dish large enough to hold chicken in a single layer

##Method
Preheat oven to 400deg F.

Trim chicken of excess fat and skin, leaving the skin on top intact. You can score the skin - slit the skin, careful not to cut into the meat. Rub taco seasoning, pepper, and oil all over chicken and under skin. Grease dish lightly with a few drops of oil, then add salsa, spreading thinly along the bottom. Place chicken skin-side-up on salsa and get it in the oven.

Bake at 400 for 15-20 minutes, turn heat to 350, and then bake another 20-30 min until chicken is cooked through.
