#The Greatest Coffee Cake

##Ingredients
1/3 cup sugar
1/4 cup flour
1/4 cup butter
1/2 cup sliced almonds

3/4 cup butter or shortening, room temperature
1 and 1/4 cup sugar
1 tsp. vanilla extract
3 eggs, room temperature
3 cups flour (all purpose or pastry)
1 and 1/2 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. salt
1 and 1/2 cup sour cream (12oz.), room temperature
1- 21oz. can of cherry pie filling (low sugar/no sugar added is best)

Milk or half-and-half
1 cup confectioner’s sugar
1/2 tsp. almond extract

##Directions
Preheat the oven to 350degF.

Make the topping: Mix the butter and sugar thoroughly. Add the flour and mix. Gently mix in the sliced almonds. Set aside.

Make the cake: Cream butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add vanilla; add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition, and continue beating until mixture is light in color and thick. Add flour, salt, and baking soda and fold in until just blended. Fold in sour cream.

Pour about half the batter into a greased 13”x9” pan. On top, spread about three-quarters of the can of pie filling as evenly as possible. Dollop on the remaining cake batter, and then scatter the rest of the pie filling on the top. Sprinkle the topping over the cake as evenly as possible. Bake cake for 45-40 minutes until puffed and golden. You can test with a skewer, avoiding the filling to get an accurate test.

Cool completely, then mix the glaze: Add milk or half-and-half to the confectioner’s sugar carefully until you get a drizzleable glaze, and mix in the almond extract. Drizzle over the cake with a spoon.

Notes:
You can change the pie filling and nuts in this recipe for a versatile treat. Walnut, cinnamon, and apple or blackberry, allspice, and toasted hazelnuts are just a few possibilities.
