#Breakfast Breads

Makes 12 rolls; start them the day before

##Ingredients:
1 and 1/4 cup bread flour
1 tsp. salt
1/2 packet of yeast, or 1 tsp. yeast
1/2 cup cool water

1 cup warm water (about 100degF)
3 and 1/2 cups bread flour
Remaining yeast, or an additional 1/2 tsp. yeast

3/4 lb. sliced deli ham
1/3 lb. sliced deli cheese
1/2 of an onion, caramelized in 2 tsp. butter and then cooled
1 shallot, diced
salt and pepper

##Method
Make the starter: Mix the first four ingredients thoroughly; it will be thick. Cover and allow to sit at room temperature overnight, or 10-12 hours.

Make the dough: Add the warm water, additional yeast and flour, and form a dough. Knead for about 10 minutes until smooth an elastic. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, 60-100minutes.

Make the rolls: Mix caramelized onion, shallot, and salt and pepper to taste. Next, punch down the dough. Cut off pieces about the size of a ping-pong ball, and pat or roll out into a circle. You want the edges of the circle thinner than the center. Lay a piece of ham on the dough, followed by a piece of cheese. Top with a spoonful of the onion mixture, fold the ham into a little packet, and bring up the edges of dough, pinching to seal thoroughly. The final product should be an oblong roll.

Place rolls seam-side down on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover, and let rolls rise in a warm place until puffed, about 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 400degF. Slash with a sharp knife or a razor, or snip with scissors, forming two slits on the top of each roll to allow steam to escape.

1. Bake for 10 minutes until puffed and set, cool, and then freeze on pans. When frozen, place into a Ziploc for storage. To prepare, place a frozen roll in a toaster oven at 350degF for 10-15 minutes.

2. Bake for 15-20 minutes until rolls are a deep golden color. Cool, and enjoy.
