#Flaky Pie Pastry

Makes pastry for one double-crust 9-inch pie, or for two single-crust pies.

##Ingredients:
2 and 2/3 cup all-purpose flour
2 Tblspn. sugar
1/2 tspn. salt
3/4 cup (1.5 sticks) very cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces
1/4 cup vegetable shortening, cut into pieces
3 tablespoons ice cold vodka
2-4 tablespoons ice cold water

##Directions:
Combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl. Using a pastry cutter, two knives, or your fingertips, cut the butter and shortening into the flour mix until the dough resembles coarse meal. The largest lumps of butter should be about the size of a dry pea and no larger. Drizzle the vodka and 2 tablespoons of water over the dough and toss together. You may add another tablespoon or two of water, but the dough should be crumbly and not at all sticky. The drier it is now, the better it will be in the end.

Divide the dough in two, shape into flattened disks, and wrap in plastic wrap. Chill for at least 45 minutes or overnight.
