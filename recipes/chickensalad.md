#Chicken Salad

Makes: a crap ton of delicious chicken salad

5 lbs. chicken breasts
2 quarts water
parsley sprigs
1 large onion, quartered
1 tsp. seasoned salt
2 chicken bouillion cubes

In a large pot, bring water and seasoning to boil, add chicken, lower heat and simmer 40 min. Remove from heat, cool. Shred chicken and refrigerate for about eight hours or so. I don't know why, but this step is very important. :/

Dressing:

1/2 cup bottled Italian salad dressing
1 cup Duke's mayonnaise(it tastes funny without Duke's, but work with what you've got)
1 Tbsp. white vinegar
1-1/2 tsp. celery seed
2 Tbsp. sugar
1/8 tsp. salt
a dash of paprika

Blend well together so its nice and mushy.

Salad:

Toss shredded chicken with one cup of dressing and let stand at least one hour to marinate.
Combine remaining dressing with:
1/2 cup sour cream
1 Tbsp. honey
Add to chicken and mix well.

You can add canned water chestnuts(just dump the whole thing in) or walnuts like my daddy likes. He's got a weird sense of taste, though, so only do this if you're feeling particularly adventurous.
