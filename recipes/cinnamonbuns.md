#Cinnamon Buns

##Ingredients
3/4 cup milk
1/4 cup unsalted butter
3 and 1/4 cup flour (all purpose or pastry)
1 package instant yeast
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 cup water, slightly warm
1 egg, room temperature

1 cup brown sugar
1 Tblspn. cinnamon
1/4 cup unsalted butter

##Method
Make the dough: Melt the butter down, and set aside to cool. Warm the milk to just above body temperature (hold you finger in it; it should feel lukewarm, certainly not uncomfortably hot). Add yeast and mix to dissolve. Add the sugar, egg, butter, salt, and water, and mix. Add the flour and mix until a dough begins to form. Knead for about ten minutes until the dough becomes smooth, glossy and elastic. Place in a greased bowl, cover, and set in a warm place for 40-60 minues until doubled in volume.

When dough has risen, punch down. Roll out on a floured board into a rectangle about 18” by 16” - this ia approximate. The larger the rectangle, the thinner the layers of bread will be, and the smaller the rolls will be, so experiment and figure out what you prefer.

Soften the butter and mix the brown sugar and cinnamon in. Spread evenly over the dough, leaving about an inch of uncovered dough at the top along the longer side. You can sprinkle on raisins or walnuts at this point if you like. Roll up the dough, starting with the long side which is spread to the edge with the filling. Cut the roll with a sharp knife, cheese wire, or piece of thread into 12-16 rolls, depending on the length. 

Place the rolls in a well-greased baking apparatus. You can use a pie pan, a rectangular pan, or even a muffin tin for well-seperated rolls. Cover and set in a warm place until risen and puffy, 20-30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375degF.

Bake for 20-40 minutes until browned; less time will be needed for muffin tins. You can frost with a simple mixture of 4 oz. softened cream cheese, 1 cup confectioners sugar, and enough milk or half-and-half to make a drizzleable, thick icing.

Tips:
Try not to cook these in a metal pan; they will brown too much on the bottom.
When kneading the dough, try not to add too much flour to deal with sticking; the dough will become less sticky as it is worked.
