Your todo list strategy, plus the paper cards/menu strategy.
super similar to Personal Kanban, as it turns out.

talk about some programming problems that have been interesting. Talk about the sites you're using.

talk about projects/motivation hacking via projects/letting things go/trying to prevent old projects from clouding the headspace.

reading? what you've read for books. Blog posts. Where you find things (twitter, hackernews, etc)
