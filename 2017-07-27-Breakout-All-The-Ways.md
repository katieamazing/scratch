Over a year ago, I wrote a version of [Breakout in Python/CodeSkulptor](http://katieamazing.com/blog/2016/05/19/breakout-in-python). Since then, I've made versions of Breakout in different languages, and I thought it was time to revisit my old Python project.

Holy jeeze, that code is ugly.

So I guess it's time to rewrite this project, and show off how much I've grown in a year+ of programming. I spent some time working with PySDL2, hoping to move my Python Breakout to a less-student-y game engine. But in the end, I found PySDL2 really frustrating (SDL-related headaches are [becoming a theme around here](http://katieamazing.com/blog/2017/07/03/C%C3%A9u-Game)), so I rewrote the game in Pygame. Pygame was originally developed to replace PySDL(1), so I didn't get that far away from SDL, but enough to make it an easier framework to deal with.


*BONUS ROUND:* check out the same project I've written in [Lua](https://github.com/katieamazing/breakout/blob/master/Moon-Flavored.lua) and [Elm](https://github.com/katieamazing/breakout/blob/master/Tree-Flavored.elm).
